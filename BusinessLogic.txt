If capacity is not a factor and the primary requirement is to ensure all destinations are visited at least once, we can simplify the schema and adjust the logic to focus on route planning and cost minimization.

Enhanced Logic

	1.	Warehouses (W):
	•	Serve as starting and restarting points for routes.
	•	Each warehouse can initiate multiple routes.

	2.	Destinations (D):
	•	All destinations must be visited at least once.
	•	A destination can be revisited for better optimization, but a new route cannot start from a destination.

	3.	Paths:
	•	Valid paths are:
	•	Warehouse → Destination.
	•	Destination → Destination.
	•	Warehouse → Warehouse.
	•	Paths are optimized to minimize the total cost.

	4.	Constraints:
	•	Every destination must be visited at least once.
	•	The algorithm can revisit destinations and warehouses to reduce overall cost and optimize time.

Tables

1. Warehouses Table

id	INT (Primary)	Unique identifier for the warehouse.
name	VARCHAR	Name of the warehouse (e.g., W1, W2).
latitude	FLOAT	Latitude coordinate of the warehouse.
longitude	FLOAT	Longitude coordinate of the warehouse.

2. Destinations Table

Column	Type	Description
id	INT (Primary)	Unique identifier for the destination.
name	VARCHAR	Name of the destination (e.g., D1, D2).
latitude	FLOAT	Latitude coordinate of the destination.
longitude	FLOAT	Longitude coordinate of the destination.

3. Paths Table

Column	Type	Description
id	INT (Primary)	Unique identifier for the path.
start_location	VARCHAR	Starting point (Warehouse/Destination).
end_location	VARCHAR	Ending point (Warehouse/Destination).
distance_km	FLOAT	Distance in kilometers between points.
cost	FLOAT	Transportation cost for the route.
is_visited	BOOLEAN	Whether the destination is visited.

Dataset Preparation Steps

1. Generate Real-World Coordinates
	•	Use Python to generate random coordinates for warehouses and destinations:
	•	Warehouses: Select key city centers.
	•	Destinations: Generate random locations around warehouses within a specified radius.

from random import uniform

# Example coordinates for warehouses
warehouses = [
    {"id": 1, "name": "W1", "latitude": 28.6139, "longitude": 77.2090},  # Delhi
    {"id": 2, "name": "W2", "latitude": 19.0760, "longitude": 72.8777}   # Mumbai
]

# Generate random destinations around these warehouses
def generate_random_destinations(n, center_lat, center_lon, radius=0.5):
    destinations = []
    for i in range(n):
        lat = uniform(center_lat - radius, center_lat + radius)
        lon = uniform(center_lon - radius, center_lon + radius)
        destinations.append({"id": i+1, "name": f"D{i+1}", "latitude": lat, "longitude": lon})
    return destinations

destinations = generate_random_destinations(5, 28.6139, 77.2090)  # Example for Delhi
print(destinations)

2. Calculate Real-World Distances
	•	Use the Google Maps Distance Matrix API or OpenStreetMap API to calculate real-life distances between:
	•	Warehouses ↔ Warehouses.
	•	Warehouses ↔ Destinations.
	•	Destinations ↔ Destinations.

Example using geopy:

from geopy.distance import geodesic

# Calculate distance between two points
def calculate_distance(coord1, coord2):
    return geodesic(coord1, coord2).kilometers

# Example coordinates
warehouse_coord = (28.6139, 77.2090)
destination_coord = (28.7041, 77.1025)

distance = calculate_distance(warehouse_coord, destination_coord)
print(f"Distance: {distance} km")

3. Assign Costs
	•	Define a cost function:
￼
	•	Example:

def calculate_cost(distance, cost_per_km=10):
    return distance * cost_per_km

cost = calculate_cost(distance)
print(f"Cost: {cost}")

4. Populate the Paths Table
	•	Store all possible paths with distances and costs.

id	start_location	end_location	distance_km	cost	is_visited
1	W1	D1	12.5	125.0	FALSE
2	D1	D2	8.7	87.0	FALSE
3	D2	W1	15.0	150.0	FALSE

Logic for Path Optimization
	1.	Ensure all destinations are visited:
	•	Start at any warehouse (W1, W2, etc.).
	•	Visit all destinations at least once.
	•	Use an algorithm like Genetic Algorithm (GA) or Dynamic Programming (similar to Traveling Salesman Problem).
	2.	Avoid Cycles:
	•	Ensure routes loop back to warehouses when needed.
	3.	Minimize Total Cost:
	•	Use cost as the objective function to minimize.
