1. Libraries and Dependencies
	•	csv: Used to save the generated data into CSV files.
	•	random.uniform: Generates random latitude and longitude within a specified radius.
	•	math (Haversine Formula): Calculates the great-circle distance between two points on Earth using their latitudes and longitudes.
	•	pandas: Converts the matrix dictionaries into tabular format and exports them as CSV files.

2. Functions

2.1. generate_coordinates
	•	Purpose: Creates random geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) around a given center.
	•	Parameters:
	•	n: Number of coordinates to generate.
	•	center_lat, center_lon: Central location’s latitude and longitude.
	•	radius: Range within which the coordinates are generated.
	•	How It Works:
	•	For each of n locations, random latitude and longitude are generated by adding/subtracting a random value within the radius.
	•	These coordinates are rounded to 6 decimal places for precision.

2.2. haversine
	•	Purpose: Calculates the distance in kilometers between two geographical points using the Haversine formula.
	•	Parameters:
	•	lat1, lon1: Latitude and longitude of the first point.
	•	lat2, lon2: Latitude and longitude of the second point.
	•	Formula:

3. Data Generation

3.1. generate_coordinates
	•	Warehouses:
	•	Generates 2 warehouses around center_lat = 34.73483 and center_lon = 135.43452 within a radius of 0.5 degrees.
	•	Destinations:
	•	Generates 4 destinations around the same center but with a larger radius of 1.0 degrees.

4. Matrix Generation

Function: generate_matrices

This function creates three matrices:
	1.	Destination vs Destination:
	•	Compares each destination with every other destination.
	•	Distance and cost are calculated for unique pairs (e.g., D1 → D2, but not D2 → D1 to avoid duplicates).
	•	Stored in a nested dictionary:

```
destination_vs_destination[dest1["id"]][dest2["id"]] = (distance, cost)
```


	2.	Warehouse vs Warehouse:
	•	Compares each warehouse with every other warehouse.
	•	Similar to the destination matrix, duplicates are avoided.
	3.	Warehouse vs Destination:
	•	Compares each warehouse with all destinations.
	•	Since warehouses and destinations are distinct, no duplicates occur.

5. Matrix Export

Function: save_matrix_to_csv
	•	Purpose: Converts the matrices into CSV files for readability and sharing.
	•	How It Works:
	•	The nested dictionary for each matrix is converted into a Pandas DataFrame using pd.DataFrame.from_dict.
	•	Rows and columns are labeled for clarity.
	•	The DataFrame is saved as a CSV file with appropriate headers.

6. Output Files

The code generates the following CSV files:
	1.	destination_vs_destination.csv:
	•	Rows and columns represent destinations.
	•	Each cell contains a tuple (distance, cost).
	2.	warehouse_vs_warehouse.csv:
	•	Rows and columns represent warehouses.
	•	Each cell contains a tuple (distance, cost).
	3.	warehouse_vs_destination.csv:
	•	Rows represent warehouses, and columns represent destinations.
	•	Each cell contains a tuple (distance, cost).

Summary
	•	Coordinates:
	•	Randomly generated locations for warehouses and destinations.
	•	Distances and Costs:
	•	Calculated using the Haversine formula and a linear cost function.
	•	Matrices:
	•	Represent relationships between destinations and warehouses.
	•	CSV Files:
	•	Provide a structured representation for analysis and visualization.

## Radius means?

When we refer to 0.5 degrees in geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude), it represents a distance on the Earth’s surface based on the angular measurement of latitude and longitude. Here’s what it means:

What is a Degree in Geography?
	•	Latitude and longitude are measured in degrees.
	•	Latitude: Measures how far north or south a point is from the Equator.
	•	Longitude: Measures how far east or west a point is from the Prime Meridian.

One degree of latitude or longitude corresponds to a certain distance on the Earth’s surface.

0.5 Degrees in Latitude
	•	Latitude measures the north-south position.
	•	The Earth’s circumference along the north-south line is about 40,075 km.
	•	One degree of latitude equals approximately 111.32 km.
	•	0.5 degrees of latitude equals:
￼

So, when we generate a coordinate within 0.5 degrees latitude, it means we are allowing a random variation of up to ~55.66 km north or south from the center point.

0.5 Degrees in Longitude
	•	Longitude measures the east-west position and varies with latitude because meridians converge at the poles.
	•	Near the Equator, one degree of longitude equals about 111.32 km.
	•	At 34.73483° N (center_lat):
	•	The Earth’s circumference at this latitude shrinks due to the cosine of the latitude angle.
	•	One degree of longitude at this latitude equals:
￼
	•	0.5 degrees of longitude equals:
￼

So, a variation of 0.5 degrees longitude means up to ~46.18 km east or west of the center point.

Summary

When the code generates random coordinates within 0.5 degrees:
	•	Latitude: ± 55.66 km north or south.
	•	Longitude: ± 46.18 km east or west (at latitude 34.73483° N).

This defines a rectangular area of approximately:
￼
within which the warehouses are randomly positioned.
